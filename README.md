## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up and Run Locally

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js and npm** (or Yarn) (Required for Angular).
* **For PHP Backend:** A web server (Apache/Nginx) and PHP (specify version, e.g., 8.x).
* **For ASP.NET Backend:** .NET SDK (specify version, e.g., .NET 8).
* **Database Management System (DBMS):** Your chosen database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName.git)
    cd YourProjectName
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend # Or 'server', 'api', etc., depending on your project structure
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    * **If PHP:**
        ```bash
        composer install # If you're using Composer
        ```
    * **If ASP.NET:**
        ```bash
        dotnet restore
        ```
4.  **Database Configuration:**
    * Create a new database (e.g., `your_database_name`).
    * Update your database connection settings in the appropriate configuration file (e.g., `.env` for PHP, `appsettings.json` for ASP.NET).
    * Run database migrations (if applicable):
        * **PHP (e.g., Laravel):** `php artisan migrate`
        * **ASP.NET Core (e.g., Entity Framework):** `dotnet ef database update`
5.  **Start the backend server:**
    * **If PHP:**
        ```bash
        php artisan serve # For Laravel development server
        # Or configure your web server (Apache/Nginx) to point to your public directory.
        ```
    * **If ASP.NET:**
        ```bash
        dotnet run
        ```
    * (The backend will usually run on `http://localhost:port_number`. Check your console output for the exact URL.)

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    * (From the project root, go into your frontend folder):
        ```bash
        cd frontend # Or 'client', 'angular-app', etc., depending on your project structure
        ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # Or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure API URL:**
    * You might need to update the Angular environment file (e.g., `src/environments/environment.ts` or `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`) to point to your backend API URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api`).
4.  **Start the Angular application:**
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
5.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` (the default port for Angular apps).
